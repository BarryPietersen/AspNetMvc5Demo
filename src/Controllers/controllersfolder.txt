by convention this folder contains all of our MVC controller classes
Controllers must come under the namespace PrjectName.Controllers to be recognised as controllers
Controllers must inherit from the base class Controller in order to behave like an mvc controller
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

remeber our definition for controllers:
-Provide a set of useful properties and behaviours inherited from the base class ‘Controller’
-Contain our ‘Action Methods’ which process requests, any data that has been packaged with a request and generate appropriate responses.
-Action Methods are invoked and our request/response processing begins by making calls to external resources such as database and other domain specific logic.
-Controllers Group together related Action Methods 
-Controllers pass models and other data to the appropriate views or generate other response types
