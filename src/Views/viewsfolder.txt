by default when we create a new controller visual studio will automatically create a subfolder
within the Views folder with the same name as the controller but without the 'Controller' suffix
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the Views folder contains all of the websites cshtml, aspx, _ViewStart.cshtml and the shared folder we are already familiar with  

remeber when an action method is invoked with a view by default the first folder it will look to will be the folder
that matches the controller name for example HomeController.Index() will result in the Views/Home/Index.cshtml being searched
MVC will ultimately search all subfolders and files within the Views folder for the named view as a last minute attempt
