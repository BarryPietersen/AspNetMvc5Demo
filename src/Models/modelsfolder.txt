in this folder we store all of our model classes and application/domain specific types.
refernce these classes under the namespace using projectname.Models, in the case of this demo - MvcDemo.Models
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

remeber our definitions for models
-These classes represent data and behaviours of our domain specific objects in the form of regular C# classes
-Often store data retrieved from a database
-Have no dependency on the controllers or views
-Easy to package data and process them in either a view response or other ActionResult types
